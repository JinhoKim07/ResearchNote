# ATF3, PI. WH Kim

## 240622, Research Note

* 4m / 12m merged data -> CV 0.3 and FPKM sum over 20 -> 2 genes are remained after filtering.
*

## 240617, Discussion w/ PI

* P value from FPKM over 20 genes
  * Union (4M and 12M)
  * Seperate.. 4M and 12M

## 240612, Discussion

* FPKM over 20 at least 1 group -> mininum criteria
  * ... P value? over 20?
  * Analysis group? 4M+20M or 4M / 20M

## 240610, Progress Meeting w/ PI

* Human ATF3 over-expression, ROS treated
  * Cardiomegaly was observed -> "Heart Development" term observed in GORILLA
* To Do List
  * GEO Upload all data
  * 4M / 12M used.
  * Cell proliferation, Heart Development
  * Heatmap, PCA, Volcano plot
