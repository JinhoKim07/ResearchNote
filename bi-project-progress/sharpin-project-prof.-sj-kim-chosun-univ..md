* Sharpin -> Stat3 -> Bst2 (Oncogene like?)
* RNA-seq re-analysis (HB)
* scRNA-seq in Gastric Cancer

### scRNA Analysis

* scRNA-seq in [PMID: **34642171**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34642171/)
  * [GSE183904](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183904)
  * Raw files were not submitted due to patient privacy concerns
* For each sample, count table uploaded in GEO
  * Download all files (HB)
  * and analysis (w/ batch correction in paper)
* Sharpin, Stat3, Bst2 expression profile in Tumor.
