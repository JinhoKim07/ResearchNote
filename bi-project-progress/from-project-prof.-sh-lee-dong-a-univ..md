# FROM Project, Prof. SH Lee (Dong-A Univ.)

## 240703, Short Discussion w/ PI

* find DMR for marker of iAs, sum4As
  * Including Intergenic regions

## 240610, Short Discussion w/ PI

* For iAsgp, statistical significant difference observed in MCV.
  * RBC development? -> Phenotype?
* or Epigentic marker?

## 240523, LabMeeting&#x20;

* DMR analysis -> Done&#x20;
* DML analysis -> Done
* Locus analysis
  * ML Approach (Prediction) failed
    * Feature Selection -> XGBoost, RF : failed, overfitting issue
    * Patterns are does not exist.
  * (NEXT) Statistical Approach
    * $$R^2$$ Approach, w/ selected features
    * including CpG in Intergenic
  * (NEXT) Summary all results
