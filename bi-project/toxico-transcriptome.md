# Toxico Transcriptome

## 240525, Short Discussion

### Paper Structure

#### Concepts

> Gene Level -> No difference, Transcript level -> little difference, balance disrupted

> RI -> **It is the most sensitive marker and a critical factor that manifests even at low exposure levels.**

**The main figure shows logFC and PValue, with expressions provided in the supplementary materials.**

* Fig 1. All group analysis, gene-level&#x20;
  * There is no changes in DEG
* Fig 2-4. Expand to Transcript-level
  * Fig 2. Concept of Alternative Splicing, Expression varied
  * Fig 2 or 3. GO all
  * Fig 3 or 4. Up and Down transcript analysis, select major transcript in CTL
* Fig 5. RI Analysis, Up-reg in treatment group
* Fig 6. RI Downstream Analysis
* Fig 7. Conclusion?

### Chemical Grouping

* Phenol Group
  * BPA, BPF, BPS, NP, Triclosan
* VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds),
  * Benzene, Fu, HCB, NAP, Xylene, Toluene, TE
  * HCB : Weak corerlation
  * **Due to its high volatility, the effectiveness may be reduced.**
* Pthalate
  * DEHP, MCXX, MEXXX, MbZP, MnBP
  * DEHP: Pthalate Di- group
  * Others, Mono group -> detoxified in cell
* Similar Chemical Structure, Differing Only in Physical Properties
  * Paraben, EP, PP, MP
* Pesticide
  * Mirex, NAP, HCB
* Multi-Benezne Ring&#x20;
  * BAP, NAP
* Heavy Metal Group
  * AC, CdCl2, CH, Hg, Pb
* Others
  * Cotinine, Mirex
  * Cotinine, detoxified Nicotine
  * Mirex, Structurally independent
