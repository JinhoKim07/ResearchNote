## 240520, CpG/non-CpG Methylation Pattern

### Meeting

- Failed to detect non-CpG patterns among TSS/TES/Top/Bot
  - mlvl of TES Top is similar to others (cumulative plots)
  - TES +- 100bp and TSS +- 100bp versus All PC genes
  - TES +- 300bp and TSS +- 300bp versus All PC genes
  - Top All and Bot All are same as 4 groups
- (Future work) How to filter zero or sparse regions?
- (Future work) Top and Bot gene selection criteria?

### Plan

* CpG and non-CpG methylation in individual tissue : Cumulative and boxplot

> Q. CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns in genomic region?

* TSS, Exon, Intron, TSS : Cumulative and boxplot

> Q. If non-CpG methylation level in TTS is low, What is the role of non-CpG in TSS?

* RNA polymerase II termination events in lowly non-CpG methylation regions
  * RNA PolII termination index calculation
  * Correlation Plots b/w non-CpG methylation on TTS and RNA PolII

* DML files copied from other directories
* PC Gene, Top/Bot Gene: mC level boxplot and cumulative plot
* Future Works,
  * mC level for Genomic Regions (TSS, TES)
