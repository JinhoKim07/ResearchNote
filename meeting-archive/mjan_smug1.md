# Smug1 Project, MJ An

## 240520, CpG/non-CpG Methylation Pattern 

### Plan

- CpG and non-CpG methylation in individual tissue : Cumulative and boxplot

> Q. CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns in genomic region?

- TSS, Exon, Intron, TSS : Cumulative and boxplot 

  > Q. If non-CpG methylation level in TTS is low, What is the role of non-CpG in TSS?

- RNA polymerase II termination events in lowly non-CpG methylation regions 

  - RNA PolII termination index calculation
  - Correlation Plots b/w non-CpG methylation on TTS and RNA PolII
